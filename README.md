# UWLabs
Over the 2021-2022 school year, I have been working on progressing my knowledge of the Java language. From the program "UW in the High School," I have been taking CSE 142
in my local high school. The files in this folder are the labs that I worked on during this school year. 

In the UWLabs Information File, all of the labs are listed with their respective progress marks. Those that have been finalized are marked as such, and those that have
been submitted are marked with a "!" at the end. If you have any questions, feel free to message me.
